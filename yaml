## ðŸ“– Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with **Universal Differential Equations (UDEs)**.
- Integration of **mechanistic models with machine learning**.
- Practical exposure to **SciML ecosystem in Julia**.
- Application of **optimization techniques** (gradient-based + quasi-Newton).

---

## ðŸ”® Future Work
- Extend UDE approach to other nonlinear dynamical systems.
- Experiment with different neural architectures (e.g., recurrent networks).
- Apply to real-world time series such as ecological, financial, or epidemiological data.
